  abstract = {Abstract             Citation indexes are by now part of the research infrastructure in use by most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with the increasing amounts of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory characteristics for humanities scholars, while no comprehensive citation index is published by a public organisation. We argue that an open citation index for the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve and accelerate the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all stakeholders (including publishers) and it would contribute research data to fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that the citation index should be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the humanities. We discuss four such requirements: source coverage must be comprehensive, including books and citations to primary sources; there needs to be chronological depth, as scholarship in the humanities remains relevant over time; the index should be collection driven, leveraging the accumulated thematic collections of specialised research libraries; and it should be rich in context in order to allow for the qualification of each citation, for example, by providing citation excerpts. We detail the fit-for-purpose research infrastructure which can make the Humanities Citation Index a reality. Ultimately, we argue that a citation index for the humanities can be created by humanists, via a collaborative, distributed and open effort.},

Reflecting on an international study of academic publishing that has been framed within the lens of Southern theory, this article explores some of the issues facing those who work and publish in the global South, and offers an analysis of several of the mechanisms that assist to maintain the inequalities of the knowledge system. The focus then moves to an examination of some recent developments in academic publishing which challenge the dominance of the global North: the building of alternative transnational circuits of publishing that provide effective pathways for the distribution of academic knowledge from `inside the global South'.},

Given the important implications that such underrepresentation may have on the careers of women researchers, it is important to determine whether this same trend is true in subdisciplines of the field, where interventions might be more effective. Here, we report the results of an extension of the analyses carried out by Dworkin et al. (2020) to citation patterns in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (             JoCN             ). The results indicate that the underrepresentation of women-led publications in reference sections is also characteristic of papers published in             JoCN             over the past decade. Furthermore, this pattern of citation imbalances is present for all gender classes of authors, implicating systemic factors. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that intentional action is needed to address inequities in the way that we carry out and communicate our science.},

The deluge of scholarly articles makes it difficult to locate the most relevant prior work and causes researchers to spend a considerable amount of time building up their literature list. Citations play a significant role in discovering relevant literature. However, not all citations are created equal. A majority of the citations that a paper receives are for providing contextual, and background information to the citing papers and are not central to the theme of those papers. However, some papers are pivotal to the citing paper and inspire or stem up the research in the citing paper. Hence the nature of citation the former receives from the latter is significant. In this work in progress paper, we discuss our preliminary idea towards establishing a lineage for a given research via identifying significant citations. We hypothesize that such an automated system can facilitate relevant literature discovery and help identify knowledge flow for at least a certain category of papers. The distal goal of this work is to identify the real impact of research work or a facility beyond direct citation counts.},

We have presented a review of metrics for citation analysis, categorised according to their applicability for evaluating journals and conferences. The citation metrics may also be categorised as popularity measuring and prestige measuring. Prestige measuring indicators like SCImago Journal Rank (SJR) and Eigenfactor have already gained popularity for evaluating journals. We discuss their role in evaluating the conferences. Indeed, some conferences have already started mentioning their prestige score in terms of the SJR of their conference proceedings. We also propose a Normalised Immediacy Index (                                                                        I                                                                     I                                                                       norm                                                                                                              ), a variant of the Immediacy Index (                                                                        II                                                                  ), to measure the immediate relevance of articles published in a journal/conference.

This translates into journals becoming more selective, and, ultimately, into higher publication standards. However, the fixation on higher impact factors leads some journals to artificially boost impact factors through the coordinated effort of a ``citation cartel'' of journals. ``Citation cartel'' behavior has become increasingly common in recent years, with several instances being reported. Here, we propose an algorithm---named CIDRE---to detect anomalous groups of journals that exchange citations at excessively high rates when compared against a null model that accounts for scientific communities and journal size. CIDRE detects more than half of the journals suspended from Journal Citation Reports due to anomalous citation behavior in the year of suspension or in advance. Furthermore, CIDRE detects many new anomalous groups, where the impact factors of the member journals are lifted substantially higher by the citations from other member journals. We describe a number of such examples in detail and discuss the implications of our findings with regard to the current academic climate.},

The main findings are: (a) For social science subject categories in both the               Web of Science               and Scopus, the average citation levels of articles in Mono and Multi are very similar; and (b) for Scopus subject categories within life sciences, health sciences, and physical sciences, the average citation level of Mono articles is roughly twice that of Multi articles. Hence, one cannot assume that in general, multidisciplinary research will be more highly cited, and the converse is probably true for many areas of science. A policy implication is that, at least in the sciences, multidisciplinary researchers should not be evaluated by citations on the same basis as monodisciplinary researchers.},

  abstract = {Background               Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) may play an important role in various cardiovascular diseases, including HFpEF and both obstructive and non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). To date, there has been no bibliometric analysis to summarize this field. Here, we aim to conduct a bibliometric analysis of CMD to determine the current status and frontiers in this field.                                         Materials and methods               Publications about CMD were taken from the Web of Science Core Collection database (WOSCC). WOSCC's literature analysis wire, the VOSviewer 1.6.16, and CiteSpace 5.1.3 were used to conduct the analysis.                                         Results               A total of 785 publications containing 206 reviews and 579 articles are included in the sample. The leading authors are Iacopo Olivotto, Paolo G. Camici, and Carl J. Pepine. The most productive institutions are the University of Florence, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, and Harvard University. The most productive countries are the USA, Italy, and England. There are a total of 237 journals that contribute to this field, and the leading journals in our study were the International Journal of Cardiology, the European Heart Journal and the JACC. From 2012 to 2021, the top three most-cited articles focused on the association between HFpEF and CMD. The important keywords are heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, chest pain, women, coronary flow reserve (CFR), endothelial dysfunction and prognostic value. ``Positron emission tomography'' shows the strongest burst strength, followed by ``blow flow'' and ``artery.'' The keywords that started to burst from 2015 are particularly emphasized, including ``heart failure,'' ``coronary flow reserve,'' and ``management.''                                         Conclusion               Studies about CMD are relatively limited, and the largest contribution comes from the USA, Italy and England. More studies are needed, and publications from other countries should be enhanced. The main research hotspots in the CMD field include CMD in patients with HFpEF, sex differences, the new methods of diagnosis for CMD, and the effective treatment of CMD. Attention should be given to CMD in patients with HFpEF, and untangling the association between CMD and HFpEF could be helpful in the development of physiology-stratified treatment for patients with CMD and HFpEF.},

  abstract = {Disparities continue to pose major challenges in various aspects of science. One such aspect is editorial board composition, which has been shown to exhibit racial and geographical disparities. However, the literature on this subject lacks longitudinal studies quantifying the degree to which the racial composition of editors reflects that of scientists. Other aspects that may exhibit racial disparities include the time spent between the submission and acceptance of a manuscript and the number of citations a paper receives relative to textually similar papers, but these have not been studied to date. To fill this gap, we compile a dataset of 1,000,000 papers published between 2001 and 2020 by six publishers, while identifying the handling editor of each paper. Using this dataset, we show that most countries in Asia, Africa, and South America (where the majority of the population is ethnically non-White) have fewer editors than would be expected based on their share of authorship. Focusing on US-based scientists reveals Black as the most underrepresented race. In terms of acceptance delay, we find, again, that papers from Asia, Africa, and South America spend more time compared to other papers published in the same journal and the same year. Regression analysis of US-based papers reveals that Black authors suffer from the greatest delay. Finally, by analyzing citation rates of US-based papers, we find that Black and Hispanic scientists receive significantly fewer citations compared to White ones doing similar research. Taken together, these findings highlight significant challenges facing non-White scientists.},

The study identifies 11,842 HCRs in all fields and uses Gender-API, Genderize.Io, Namsor, and the web to identify their gender. Women's share of HCRs grew from 13.1\% in 2014 to 14.0\% in 2021; however, the increase is slower than that of women's representation among the general population of authors. The data show that women's share of HCRs would need to increase by 100\% in health and social sciences, 200\% in agriculture, biology, earth, and environmental sciences, 300\% in mathematics and physics, and 500\% in chemistry, computer science, and engineering to close the gap with men. Women's representation among all HCRs in North America, Europe, and Oceania ranges from 15\% to 18\%, compared to a world average of 13.7\%. Among countries with the highest number of HCRs, the gender gap is least evident in Switzerland, Brazil, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States and most noticeable in Asian countries. The study reviews factors that can be seen to influence the gender gap among HCRs and makes recommendations for improvement.},

  abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science---a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent.},

Since this systematic bias in scientific information and recognition practices fits the second half of Matthew 13:12 in the Bible, which refers to the under-recognition accorded to those who have little to start with, it is suggested that sociologists of science and knowledge can add to the 'Matthew Effect', made famous by Robert K. Merton in 1968, the 'Matilda Effect', named for the American suffragist and feminist critic Matilda J. Gage of New York, who in the late nineteenth century both experienced and articulated this phenomenon. Calling attention to her and this age-old tendency may prod future scholars to include other such 'Matildas' and thus to write a better, because more comprehensive, history and sociology of science.},

Who we cite reflects and reinforces both the boundaries and hierarchies of academic knowledge, covertly shaping not only whose research is legitimized and valued but also whose careers are advanced. Citations, the currency of the academy with power to reinforce or dismantle hierarchies that privilege dominant knowledge systems cannot thus be a neutral, apolitical act. This paper unpacks the concept of citation politics and its role in sustaining epistemic hierarchies within scholarly communities. Rather than framing citation bias as a matter of individual oversight, we position it as a systemic issue tied to academic structures, norms, and incentive systems. We introduce a comprehensive and openly accessible Citational Justice Toolkit, developed by the FORRT community, which curates actionable resources, tools, and practices helping scholars and institutions to audit, diversify, and reflect on their citation practices across the research cycle. Our aim is to support a shift from tokenistic inclusion toward epistemically accountable, socially responsible, and structurally aware scholarship. We argue that reimagining citation as an ethical and epistemic practice is foundational to building a just and inclusive academic ecosystem, fostering pluralism, transparency, and integrity in knowledge production.},

Despite our training, practice, and prolific writing, authors who publish in top-tier anthropology journals rarely cite Black women. This citational absence reveals a paradox: although Black women play key roles in the discipline as leaders and service providers, our intellectual contributions are undervalued. We are symbolically visible yet academically eclipsed. This article examines the epistemological erasure of Black women's contributions to anthropology in the United States. Through a pilot study, we measure Black women's citation rates in some of the highest ranked anthropology journals (according to impact factor). Moving away from a one-dimensional gender analysis toward a two-dimensional, intersectional analysis that analyzes race and gender, we find that Black women are underrepresented in citations in top-tier anthropology journals relative to their absolute representation in the field. This reveals a significant and disturbing trend: Black women anthropologists are rarely cited in top-tier anthropology journals, and in the rare instances they are cited, they are cited by other Black anthropologists. There is a need for an intersectional analysis of the politics of power and inequality in anthropology, one that not only pays attention to gender discrimination but also racial discrimination.},

The Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) is presented as a way to make assessing gender balance easier with the aim of remedying the gender gap. This is followed by an outline that explains in nontechnical terms how the tool identifies author names and then predicts their gender to produce a single document-level percentage of women authors. Finally, best practices for diversity in syllabi and bibliographies are discussed, and various public sources that can be used to find scholarly work by women, as well as scholars of color, are listed.},

This article provides a comprehensive overview of existing research on the relationship between gender and citations. Three distinct approaches are identified: (1)               per-article               approach that compares gender differences in citations between articles authored by men and women, (2)               per-author               approach that compares the aggregate citation records of men and women scholars over a specified period or at the career level, and (3)               reference-ratio               approach that assesses the gender distribution of references in articles written by men and women. I show that articles written by women receive comparable or even higher rates of citations than articles written by men. However, women tend to accumulate fewer citations over time and at the career level. Contrary to the notion that women are cited less per article due to gender-based bias in research evaluation or citing behaviors, this study suggests that the primary reason for the lower citation rates at the author level is women publishing fewer articles over their careers. Understanding and addressing the gender citation gap at the author level should therefore focus on women's lower research productivity over time and the contributing factors. To conclude, I discuss the potential detrimental impact of lower citations on women's career progression and the ways to address the issue to mitigate gender inequalities in science.},
