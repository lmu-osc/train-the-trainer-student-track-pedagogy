title: "Pedagogical tools for teaching Open Research"
---


## Welcome!

On this page you will find **pedagogy materials and practical tips** on topics such as **critical didactic skills, didactics, activation methods for learners, leadership in open science and accessibility**  to successfully convey and deliver classes and workshops on Open Research topics to different audiences. 

### What is the aim?

The materials aim to **provide** you with **essential pedagogical skills** to share your Open Research knowledge and skills across **different teaching settings** (courses, seminars, workshops, in-person, virtual or hybrid settings) and **different audiences** (students, researchers, research support staff etc.). The materials consist of slide decks corresponding to a particular topic, as well as supplementary materials such as home work assignments, extra exercises or cheatsheets. Detailed **speaker notes** and **instructor notes** serve as **guidance** through the materials.

## Who are these materials for?

**Educators in higher education** (e.g., universities, colleges) aiming to:

- **Convey** foundational Open Research knowledge and skills to their learners
- **Build upon** their teaching skills across different settings
- **Boost their confidence** in their own teaching 
- **Learn** more about the surrounding issues and potential challenges of teaching about Open Research



## How can I use these materials?

The materials are completely **free to use**, given that you provide an appropriate citation Here is how you can use the materials:

1. Use the **navigation bar** on the left to navigate through the different topics. The topics are divided into broader modules, which are arranged in a **chronological order**, meaning that they logically build up on one another. If you opt for the pick-and-choose-your-topic-style, make sure to thoroughly **read the prerequisites** for each topic. 

2. When selecting a topic, you are directed to the website for the topic. The website contains a **general introduction** of the materials, the **intended target audience** as well as **prerequisites** and **learning objectives**. It also specifies the contributors and the licence details. Carefully familiarize yourself with the information provided about the topic, particularly with the prerequisites. 

3. Next, you will find the **slides corresponding to the topic** embedded in the website. You can navigate the slides in *Full Screen* using the arrow key, or by viewing the slides in *Speaker View* together with the *speaker and instructor notes* (recommended*, see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html) for more information).

4. The detailed **speaker notes** and **instructor notes** provide information about the content of the materials and many practical tips and examples how to convey the materials to your learners.
