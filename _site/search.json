To contribute to the discussion, you must be holding the ball. The aim to identify key mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities\nFirst you will Read both case studies. Then Think about mechanisms and effects and then we will come together as a group and Discuss the case studies. The pictures are also important context to the case studies.\nThere are four guiding questions to think about while you read the case studies - What are some mechanisms you can identify? - Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms? - What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies? - Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?\nInstructor Notes:\nGamifying discussions encourages all learners to contribute. Divergent questions have wider set of possible answers which facilitate deeper engagement with topic (University of Waterloo, n.d.).\nActivity delivery mode:\nif an in-person class: ask learners to stand up (if able to) in a circle. (see speaker notes). Instructor reads case studies then passes the ball to a student who makes a point then passes ball on to the next student and so on. Start by addressing each case study in turn then compare and contrast them.\nOnline class (Zoom):\nHave gallery view on Zoom, so each student is visible (ensure each student has their name written out). Instructor reads case studies then passes the imaginary ball. Passing the ball involves gesturing to throwing the ball at someone and calling their name to catch. The discussion process follows in person mode. As discussion progresses, to more easily see who has not yet spoken, have learners put hands up if they have not had the ball yet.\nHybrid class:\nFollow blend of in person and online discussion process. Ensure the case study texts are visible to both in person and online participants.\nIf student catches the ball but has no point to add they can pass the ball to another student and contribute later in the discussion. At the end, instructor can check all learners have had a chance to contribute\nAccessibility tip:\nIf learners are not able to pass the ball, instructor or nominated person can mediate the ball passing."

This combined with her interdisciplinary field, publication in smaller speciality journal and challenges with the peer review system are additional barriers for her to publish and increase her citation rate. A smaller publication record puts her at a disadvantage for academic career progression based on current evaluation methods.\nAndrew has a social support network (his aunt), collaborative research environment enabling him to cultivate collaborations, increasing opportunities to publish and even co-supervise a student.

These are key contributors to academic progression based on current evaluation methods (H-Index, publishing in prestigious journals).\nCan you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?\nUndervaluing of Adriana’s interdisciplinary knowledge, unique perspectives from having worked in industry, less research innovation within her research area."

To reactivate refresh the page.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes:\nNow it is your turn to conduct a self-audit using GBAT.\nFirst you will open your document containing a bibliography list from your own work and then try and estimate the % of women and men before using the automated tool.\nThen go to the GBAT page and follow the instructions. Once you generate your score compare this to your estimates and reflect on the process.\nYou might notice you can also estimate the racial breakdown of the author list, but these are even less accurate and so for now we will focus on gender diversity.\nInstructor Notes:\nActivity delivery mode:\nWorks in all three formats: in person, online (Zoom) and hybrid, as learners will be working independently on their computer.\nIf learners don’t have the correct format for the GBAT assessment (e.g. .ppt or .docx) you can instruct them to select and highlight the reference list, copy and paste it into a text editor (Mac = TextEdit, Windows = Notepad) and save the file with a recognizable name OR to copy text directly into the box.\nIf reference list contains bullet points, these will need to be removed before copying text into text box.\nThe GBAT tool can show “disconnected from the server” when left idle and it can be reactivated by refreshing the page\nThis exercise consolidates learning of the issues of citational inequities (section 2) and offers learners a chance to apply their knowledge to their own work by practicing a citational evaluation tool. In addition, practicing should lead to improved confidence in adopting self-auditing tools longer term."

They are choices we make in whose knowledge is valued or sidelined, reflecting the inherent biases and systemic inequalities present in academia\nCitation politics matters because these inequalities are unjust, leading to epistemic hierarchies that impact individual scholars livelihoods and the wider research ecosystem\nWe all have a role to play in addressing these inequities by doing citational self-audits and adopting tools that promote conscientious citations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake home message\n\n\n“Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” Maya Angelou\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes:\nBefore we take questions and have the end of submodule quiz let’s take the opportunity to summarize the key points of this submodule\nWe explored the concept of citational politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and practices for more contentious citations.\nCitations are more than academic bookkeeping and reflect choices we make in who we cite and who we don’t.\nMany of the mechanisms leading to citational disparities are systemic which create epistemic hierarchies\nAs individual researchers/scholars/students we can reflect on our citational practices and make choices about who we value and recognize when we cite.\nThis quote from the African American writer and poet Maya Angelou captures the process and values of addressing the politics of citation.\nInstructor Notes:\nAllow a moment to take any general questions before the quiz"

We assessed the gender diversity of our reference list using the Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) by (sumner2018?). Names were identified from the author list, and an estimate of the gender balance was produced using proboblastic techniques, where the author list in this training module contains approximately 49.32% women and 50.68% men. We acknowledge this method can misidentify an author’s gender especially those with uncommon names, names common to both genders or identifying as non-binary, transgender or gender diverse.
