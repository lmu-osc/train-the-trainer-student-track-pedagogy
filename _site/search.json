The outcome statements contain a learning activity, a verb, [that] verb says what the relevant learning activities are that the students need to undertake in order to attain the intended learning outcome. Learning is constructed by what activities the students carry out; learning is about what they do, not about what we teachers do.

Then find a partner to discuss your answers before writing out a collective response to the question. We are aiming for a sentence or two answer. Then we will come together and each pair will report back their answers before we discuss as a class.\nInstructor Notes:\nActivity delivery mode:\nIf an in-person class: Learners first think about answers individually. Learners then discuss in pairs their answers and write a collective response on a post it note. Invite learners to explain their answers, one pair at a time. Stick their post it notes answers on the class board.\nOnline class (Zoom): Have learners think independently before discussing answers in pairs in break out rooms. Ask pairs to submit their answer in a pre-prepared Mentimeter and project onto Zoom whiteboard\nHybrid class: Particify (requires in person learners to have access to device to participate). Follow steps outlined in online class mode, where in person learners and online learners pair up respectively.\nAccessibility tip:Explain to learners why the tasks are designed the way they are (link to learning objectives). Setting out expectations of the class should increase engagement (e.g. improved note taking and in class discussions)"

Then find a partner to discuss your answers before writing out a collective response to the question. We are aiming for a sentence or two answer. Then we will come together and each pair will report back their answers before we discuss as a class.\nInstructor Notes:\nActivity delivery mode:\nIf an in-person class: Learners first think about answers individually. Learners then discuss in pairs their answers and write a collective response on a post it note. Invite learners to explain their answers, one pair at a time. Stick their post it notes answers on the class board.\nOnline class (Zoom): Have learners think independently before discussing answers in pairs in break out rooms. Ask pairs to submit their answer in a pre-prepared Mentimeter and project onto Zoom whiteboard\nHybrid class: Particify (requires in person learners to have access to device to participate). Follow steps outlined in online class mode, where in person learners and online learners pair up respectively.\nAccessibility tip:Explain to learners why the tasks are designed the way they are (link to learning objectives). Setting out expectations of the class should increase engagement (e.g. improved note taking and in class discussions)"

To contribute to the discussion, you must be holding the ball. The aim to identify key mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities\nFirst you will Read both case studies. Then Think about mechanisms and effects and then we will come together as a group and Discuss the case studies.\nThere are four guiding questions to think about while you read the case studies - What are some mechanisms you can identify? - Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms? - What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies? - Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?\nInstructor notes Gamifying discussions encourages all learners to contribute. Divergent questions have wider set of possible answers which facilitate deeper engagement with topic (University of Waterloo, 2025).\n\nActivity delivery mode: if an in-person class: ask learners to stand up (if able to) in a circle. (see speaker notes). Instructor reads case studies then passes the ball to a student who makes a point then passes ball on to the next student and so on. Start by addressing each case study in turn then compare and contrast them.\nOnline class (Zoom): Have gallery view on Zoom, so each student is visible (ensure each student has their name written out). Instructor reads case studies then passes the imaginary ball. Passing the ball involves gesturing to throwing the ball at someone and calling their name to catch. The discussion process follows in person mode. As discussion progresses, to more easily see who has not yet spoken, have learners put hands up if they have not had the ball yet.\nHybrid class: Follow blend of in person and online discussion process. Ensure the case study texts are visible to both in person and online participants.\n\nIf student catches the ball but has no point to add they can pass the ball to another student and contribute later in the discussion. At the end, instructor can check all learners have had a chance to contribute\nAccessibility tip: If learners are not able to pass the ball, instructor or nominated person can mediate the ball passing."

Andrew recently had a paper published in a prestigious journal with a MSc student he co-supervised.\nThe lab head recently won a big grant allowing Andrew to extend his post doc for another year.

They reflect choices scholars make in who they cite and who they overlook in their work. There are inherent biases and systemic inequalities that result in epistemic hierarchies  \nWhy: Citation politics matters because these inequalities are unjust with big impacts on individual scholars livelihoods with wider implications for research ecosystem  \nHow: As individual scholars we have a role to play in addressing citational inequities through applying tools and practices that promote conscientious citations.\n\n\nSpeaker notes: - This submodule explored the concept of citational politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and practices for more contentious citations.\n\nThe main takeaway is that citations are more than academic bookkeeping and reflect choices we make in who we cite and who we don’t.\nMany of the mechanisms leading to citational disparities are systemic which create epistemic hierarchies\nAs individual researchers/scholars/students we can reflect on our citational practices and make choices about who we value and recognize when we cite."

Ask them to share their strategies and schedule mutual check in for the 3 check-in points to assess each other’s progress.\nOnline (Zoom): Similar format to in person, but learners will use break out rooms for pairs to discuss their citational justice action plan\nHybrid: Similar format to in person, but learners joining online will discuss citational justice action plan in break out rooms and in person learners will buddy up with in person attendees.\n\nThis task promotes self-reflection, critical thinking and a sense of agency in the choices that are made in how and who we cite.

Accountability buddy system allows learners to mutually support each other in reaching their goals and reduces anxiety.\nAllow learners time to think about their own research cycle and where they can improve their citational practices.
