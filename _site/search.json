The outcome statements contain a learning activity, a verb, [that] verb says what the relevant learning activities are that the students need to undertake in order to attain the intended learning outcome. Learning is constructed by what activities the students carry out; learning is about what they do, not about what we teachers do.

(2022)\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker Notes:\n\nWe can map knowledge relationships made up of nodes that link together using Bibliometric analyses\nThis colorful network maps out citations of documents relating to the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction. Different color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes represents the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes indicates their correlation.\nWe can also see how these knowledge maps change through time\nThis particular figure was made using VosViewer\n\nInstructor Notes:\n\nTo add an interactive element to this slide you can ask learners to guess which paper is cited the most based on figure from Lin et al. (2022). Answer is the largest node labelled as “paulus (2023)” - the red one on the top left of the image."
