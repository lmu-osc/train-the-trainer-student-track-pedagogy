::: {.notes}
Make it clear to the group that there will be a similar post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning progress.
:::

---

## Where are we at?

- **Aim**: Place the topic of the current submodule within a broader context.
- Remind students what you are working towards and what the bigger picture is.

---

## Learning goals

- **Aim**: Formulate specific, action-oriented goals learning goals which are measurable and observable in line with Bloom's taxonomy (Anderson et al., 2001; Bloom et al., 1956)

- Place an emphasis on the **verbs** of the learning goals and choose verbs that align with the skills you want to develop or assess.
- Examples: 
  - Students will **describe** the process of photosynthesis or
  - Students will **construct** a diagram illustrating the process of photosynthesis

<br>
<br>

![](images/experience-spectrum.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

::: notes
For in-person participants: Get people to stand along imaginary line across the room in terms of how much teaching experience they have. For online participants: Ask them to indicate experience on the screen. Pick out two people on either end of the spectrum (one from the in-person audience, one from online audience) and have them explain their teaching experience. Next, pick two people around the middle (one from the in-person audience, one from online audience) and have them explain and compare their experiences.
Involve your audience as early as possible, so that they pay attention in case they get called upon.

## Constructivism in learning 

As a process, learning is ...

- active and self-controlled
- student-centered
- integrated in a broader context and a positive learning atmosphere
- social and emotional


::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Efgivia et al., 2021
:::

::: notes
Use of interactive white board/ interactive document. <br>
Collect interactively: Which factors were important for your learnng process during your lest workshop/seminar/course? When do you learn worst?
:::

---

## Constructivism: Core aspects

- Knowledge is actively constructed by the learner, not imposed
- Learners bring exisiting concepts to learning situations
  - Existing ideas need to be incroporated into teaching in order to challenge/change these
- Learners construct knowledge through interaction with physical world/ social settings and within specific cultural/linguistic environments
- Learning environment is integrated into the learning process

::: notes
Ask what this could mean for the audience concretely. Call out specific names of audience members.
:::

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Sjoberg, 2010; Tauber, 2006
:::

---

## Constructional alignment

Focus here on learning objectives: what do we want (our audience) to achieve?

![](images/constructional-alignment.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Biggs, 1996
:::

::: notes
Ask if someone in your audience has already heard about this concept. Ask to provide examples.
‘In constructive alignment, we start with the outcomes we intend students to learn, and align teaching and assessment to those outcomes. The outcome statements contain a learning activity, a verb, [that] verb says what the relevant learning activities are that the students need to undertake in order to attain the intended learning outcome. Learning is constructed by what activities the students carry out; learning is about what they do, not about what we teachers do. Likewise, assessment is about how well they achieve the intended outcomes, not about how well they report back to us what we have told them or what they have read’ (Biggs n.d.).
:::

---

## "Hierarchy" learning objectives

- What is the general objective of this course?
- What are specific individual learning objectives?

![](images/objectives-hierarchy.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

---

## Bloom's taxonomy

- Three learning domains: cognitive, affective, psychomotor (https://teaching.uic.edu/cate-teaching-guides/syllabus-course-design/blooms-taxonomy-of-educational-objectives/)

| cognitive  | affective      | psychomotoric          |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|            |                | origination            |
| create     |                | adaptation             |
| evaluate   | characterising | complex overt response |
| analyse    | organising     | mechanism              |
| apply      | valuing        | guided response        |
| understand | responding     | set                    |
| remember   | receiving      | perception             |

---

## Additional slides on learning goals

---

## Examples

Can you think of examples from your own experience on what aligned learning outcomes, assessment tasks and teaching activities could look like in practise?

::: notes
Example: Learning objective = conducting an anamnestic interview with a patient. Teaching activites = role plays. Assessment task = Anamnestic interview with fake/real patient. 
:::

---

## Formulating learning objectives

![](images/formulating-learning-objectives.png){width=100%, fig-align="center"}

Example: Formulate one learning objective for your own seminar. 

::: notes
Pick a learning goal from previous examples or collect learning goals interactively. Examine learning goals more closely in the group and discuss what could be a suitable learning goal and why/why not. Focus on what verbs are being used. 
:::

---

## Structuring your course

- Check your working conditions: how much time do I have? How long are the sessions? Mielstones?
- Plan time for orientation during first and last session: who is who? What is happening? What is expected? What remains unclear?
- Formulate learning objectives for course
- Formulate learning objectives for each session

---

## Attitude towards your audience

What can you do to create a positive learning environment?

::: notes
What do you think are key aspects of a positive attitude towards your audience? Collect on papers and then try to sort into  verbally, body language and methods.
:::

---

## Attitudes towards your audience: Verbal

- Small-talk (yes, it is important)
- Call by name
- Validate and show appreciation
- Paraphrase what audience members express
- Give tangible examples
- Ask open questions
- Accept silences

---

## Attitudes towards your audience: body language

- Maintain eye contact with students
- Use non-verbal communication (shake head, use hands)

---

## Attitudes towards your audience: methods

- Have introductory round
- Motivate audience to get involved as early as possible
- Observe the room
- Use different visualisation methods/tools

::: notes
Collect examples for each one of the bullet points and what they could mean - add to the existing papers. 
:::

---

## Interactive teaching methods

transition to activation method

---

## Your turn!

Take 20 minutes in pairs to practise an activation method of your choice in the context of a topic of your choice. Each pair demonstrates the activity in "class", with the rest acting as audience. 

::: notes
Interactively ask participants to provide feedback on the selected method, delivery and improvement points.
