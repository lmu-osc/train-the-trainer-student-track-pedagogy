# About these materials

**Welcome!** This workshops aims to examine the concept of citational politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and practices for more conscientious citations. Across different sections, we will think  about the *what* and the *why* of citations and **when** to use them, examine the *mechanisms* and *consequences* of citational inequities and learn how to **conduct a citational self-audit**, before wrapping up with a summary exercice. 


### Who are these materials for?

The target audience of this workshop is threefold:

- **Educators** in **higher education** (e.g., universities, research institutes) or other teaching contexts aiming to **develop their pedagogical skills and leadership skills** in the context of Open Research by exploring critical issues connected to both Open Research and teaching Open Research practices to various audiences. You can follow the materials by chronologically going through the slides and following along the practical exercises. You **go at your own pace** and within your own timeframe. *Presenter notes* will help you to understand and reflect on the content of the materials. Note: Group exercises are *not* possible in this asynchronous setting. 

- **Educators** in **higher education** (e.g., universities, research institutes) or other teaching contexts aiming to **convey this topic to their learners** in a synchronous (in-person, virtual or hybrid) class-room setting. The slides can be directly presented in full screen below, with presenter and instructor notes providing guidance about the narrative of the materials and valuable pedagogical tips how to convey the materials to your learners. You can also download the PowerPoint slides corresponding to the materials below and adapt the materials to your learners. Make sure to give appropriate credit to the original authors. 

## Prerequisites

You will need access to a piece of your **own work** (a report, essay, journal article, blogpost, presentation) containing a **bibliography** with **10 or more references**, preferably in **.bib** or **.txt** file format (this is needed for the [GBAT assessment](https://jlsumner.shinyapps.io/syllabustool/)).
