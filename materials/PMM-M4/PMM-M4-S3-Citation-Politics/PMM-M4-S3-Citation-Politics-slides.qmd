## Your citation politics journey

<br> <br> From: *"I am not sure what citation politics is or why it is important"* <br> <br> To: "*I feel empowered to adopt more contentious citation practices"*

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: This journey aims to take you from the what or why is citation politics important? to feeling empowered to be more contentious in your citation practices.

**Instructor Notes**: Communicating the overall learning outcomes as a journey helps embed the step by step build up of complexity of the topic (i.e. moving along Bloom's Taxonomy levels).

*Accessibility Tip*: It is a good idea to pre-warn learners that some of the topics covered might be upsetting, particularly to those who have experienced academic injustices. Consider signposting resources for support for learners to access if needed.

## Section 1: Introduction to citations

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/1_section_1_citations.png" style="width:45%;"/>
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: In this first section we will take a look at what citations are.
:::

---

## Warm up question to get us started!

::: incremental
**What are citations, and why do we cite?**

1.  *Think* about answer on your own
2.  *Discuss* answer with neighbor and *write* out a joint answer
3.  We will *share* our answers in class
:::

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*: We will now do a think-pair-share activity based on a two part question: What are citations, and why do we cite?

On your own you will first think about the answer. Then find a partner to discuss your answers before writing out a collective response to the question. We are aiming for a sentence or two answer. Then we will come together and each pair will report back their answers before we discuss as a class.

**Instructor Notes**: Activity delivery mode:

-   If an in-person class: Learners first think about answers individually. Learners then discuss in pairs their answers and write a collective response on a post it note. Invite learners to explain their answers, one pair at a time. Stick their post it notes answers on the class board.

-   Online class (Zoom): Have learners think independently before discussing answers in pairs in break out rooms. Ask pairs to submit their answer in a pre-prepared white board on <http://scrumblr.ca/>

-   Hybrid class: Particify (requires in person learners to have access to device to participate). Follow steps outlined in online class mode, where in person learners and online learners pair up respectively.

*Accessibility Tip:* Explain to learners why the tasks are designed the way they are (link to learning objectives). Setting out expectations of the class should increase engagement (e.g. improved note taking and in class discussions)
:::

## What are citations?

::: callout-note
## Definition

-   A reference to an information *source*, where the original author is given *credit*.

-   Citations map out the lineage of ideas upon which scholarship is built and informs what knowledge we *value* and whose knowledge we *platform*.

-   Citations are a key *currency* in academia where more citations equal more *prestige* (e.g. H-Index)[@sauvé].
:::

For example, this definition cites work by Sauvé and colleagues from 2025 where the full reference will appear in the bibliography at the end.

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: In everyday life we use citations, perhaps without realizing, for example verbal citations “X said this y”.

This is the basis for the basic definition of a citation: a reference to an information source, where the original author is given credit.

But citations are more than referencing an information source

In the current academic system, patterns of citations reflect dominant world views (Western, racialized white men, Anglophone, non-disabled, higher socio-economic status).

How and who we cite informs what type of knowledge we value and whose knowledge we platform.

**Instructor Notes**: Link definition presented here to answers learners gave in the warm up question.
:::

## Citations as a knowledge map

::: incremental
-   Citations play an important role in tracing the *conceptual* origins and evolution of *ideas* during literature searches [@ghosal2021]

-   Citations are used to provide background *context* to piece of work, particularly in introductory sections.

-   Some papers cite other works with closely tied research themes, *build* on these ideas and *push* the boundaries of knowledge in new directions.
:::

::: callout-tip
## Did you know?

The study of citations and other bibliographic data is known as *bibliometrics* [@donthu2021]

## Analyzing citation practices

*Bibliometric* analyses can reveal patterns in citation practices (e.g. most cited papers or scholars and citational clusters)

:::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/2_citation_map.png" style="width:40%;"/>

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
<em>Figure adapted from [@lin2022]</em>
:::
::::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: Citation practices can be analyzed using bibliometric analyses. It can show you who cites who and identify clusters of citation bubbles.

This colorful network maps by Lin et al shows the citations of documents relating to the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction. Different color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes represents the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes indicates their correlation.

**Instructor Notes**: Indicate that the next slide the components of this network map will be explained.
:::

## Components of citation maps

::::: columns
::: column
![](images/3_citation_map_analogy.png)
:::

::: column
-   A *node* is like a busy urban center with *links* to other nodes via highways, where several nodes can form *clusters*

-   Analogy: the Putuo, Hongkou, Sanlinzhen districts (*nodes*) have closer *links* forming city of Shanghai (*cluster*) compared to districts in Jiaxing \>100 km away
:::
:::::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: We can map knowledge relationships made up of nodes that link together using Bibliometric analyses.

This colorful network maps out citations of documents relating to the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction. Different color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes represents the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes indicates their correlation.

We can also see how these knowledge maps change through time. This particular figure was made using VosViewer.

**Instructor Notes**: To add an interactive element to this slide you can ask learners to guess which paper is cited the most based on figure from Lin *et al.* (2022). Answer is the largest node labelled as "paulus (2023)" - the red one on the top left of the image.

## Citation metrics as an evaluation tool

-   Citation metrics (e.g. H-Index) are an evaluation tool used to make important decisions like career progression, funding allocations and conference speaker invites [@gupta2025].

::: callout-note
# Definition

-   Hirsch's Index (H-Index) is an author-level metric used to assess *productivity* and *impact* of publications [@hirsch2005]

-   It is calculated by the number of publications with citation number ≥ h (e.g. if a scholar has a total of 10 publications and 7 of those each have at least 7 citations, then their H-Index = 7)
:::

-   Scholars with higher H-Indices are often evaluated more highly, but there are inherit *biases* with this...

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: Citation metrics like the H-Index are an evaluation tool used to make important decisions like career progression, funding allocations and conference speaker invites.

This metric was developed by a physicist Jorge Hirsch who was looking to create objective measure of scientific achievement in his field of theoretical physics.

It is an author-level metric calculated by the number of publications with citation number greater or equal to h.

For example: if a scholar has a total of 10 publications and 7 of those each have at least 7 citations, then their H-Index = 7.

**Instructor Notes**: To provide more context about H-Indices you can share some examples of famous scholars e.g. Albert Einstein who has an H-Index of 129 (as of 10/09/2025 on Google Scholar).
:::

---

## Biases in citation metrics

The number of citations is not only a measure of *quality* and *productivity*, as being highly cited relies on *opportunities* to publish a lot which links to:

-   **Academic** factors: career stage, academic discipline, institutional affiliation, mentoring, support networks.
-   **Social, cultural** and **economic** factors: gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status, disability.

Where these factors *interact* and *compound* resulting in disparities in citation rates.

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: The number of citations is not only a measure of *quality* and *productivity*, as being highly cited relies on *opportunities* to publish a lot.

It also does not necessarily correlate with validity of a publication and can be skewed towards trending research topics.

There are many factors that can influence how many publication you have or even if you can publish your work.

These factors can be academic in nature such as whether you are early career or niche academic discipline. Other factors relate to your socio-economic and cultural identities.

Each of these factors *interact* and *compound* resulting in disparities in citation rates.
:::

---

## Citations as a politic

-   Citations are more than a technical formality
-   Citation practices are not neutral as they reflect an academic system that is unequal
-   There is lots of evidence to show citational biases towards Anglophone racialized white men across disciplines [@sauvé]

::: callout-note
## Definition

-   Citation politics reflects *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who they overlook in their work.
-   There are inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* that result in epistemic hierarchies – that is the recognition and legitimization of *dominant* world views at the *exclusion* of others knowledge systems [@sauvé]
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

As we saw with the example knowledge map, it is evident when we see a highly cited paper. Citations reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who they overlook in their work.

It is just not about merit - there are inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* that result in epistemic hierarchies – that is the recognition and legitimization of *dominant* world views at the *exclusion* of others knowledge systems (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).

In the next section we will look at citation politics in more detail

:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: In this section we will take a look at the mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities.

We'll start with briefly looking at studies that document citational disparities and then at the mechanisms contributing to these disparities.

<img src="images/5_citational_inequities_examples.png" style="width:62%;"/>
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: This collage of screenshots showcase a selection of recent articles documenting citational disparities across multiple marginalized groups (Black women, Indigenous scholars, transgender researchers) and disciplines (anthropology and neuroscience). The references for these screenshots will appear at the end.

**Instructor Notes**: Highlight to learners that these examples are recent 2018-2024 and the issue of citation politics is not an issue of the "golden days" of academia.
:::

---

## Patterns of citational inequities (II)

-   There is currently more research on *gender bias* in citation patterns than for other marginalized identities (e.g. *Matilda effect*)

-   This does not mean other marginalized scholars are not also experiencing a lack of citation!

-   Identities are *multifaceted*, where scholars with more marginalized identities face *compounding barriers*

::: callout-tip
## Did you know?

-   The women's share of highly cited researchers (HCRs) *increased 0.9%* from 13.1% in 2014 to 14.0% in 2021.

-   To reach *parity* with men, women's share of HCRs would need to increase *100%* in health and social sciences and *500%* in engineering, chemistry and computer science [@meho2022].

-   This is an example of the *Matilda effect* - the systematic undervaluing of women's contributions to research [@rossiter1993].
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: There is currently more research on gender bias in citation patterns than for other marginalized identities.

For example this case study on highly cited researchers: The women's share of highly cited researchers (HCRs) *increased 0.9%* from 13.1% in 2014 to 14.0% in 2021.

To reach *parity* with men, women's share of HCRs would need to increase *100%* in health and social sciences and *500%* in engineering, chemistry and computer science.

This is an example of the *Matilda effect* - the systematic undervaluing of women's contributions to research.

A reminder that an absence of published evidence, does not mean marginalized scholars are not also experiencing a lack of citation and erasure!

Identities are multifaceted, where scholars with more marginalized identities face compounding barriers.

**Instructor Notes**: Highlighting the Matilda effect offers a smooth transition into the following section about types of mechanisms leading to citational inequities.
:::

---

## Mechanisms of citational inequities

-   **Socio-economic and cultural** mechanisms: operate at *systemic*, *structural* and *inter-personal* levels relating to systems in our society such economic, political and health (e.g. *racism* and *sexism*)

-   **Academic** mechanisms: relate to *policies*, *practices*, and *norms* occurring *within* the *academic system* (e.g., *citational cliques*)

::: callout-note
## Mechanism levels

*Systemic* emphasizes whole systems. *Structural* refers to the embedded policies/practices that provide scaffolding of systems. *Inter-personal* is about interactions and behaviors between people and teams [@braveman2022]. Mechanism levels can overlap!
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: Socio-economic and academic are two main types of mechanisms leading to the *under representation* of *marginalized* scholars and *over representation* of *privileged* scholars in reference lists.

You may be more familiar with socio-economic mechanisms such as racism and sexism which operate at *systemic*, *structural* and *inter-personal* levels.

These relate to systems in our society such economic, political and health.

Academic mechanisms relate to *policies*, *practices*, and *norms* occurring *within* the *academic system* (e.g. *citational cliques*). We will look at some of these mechanisms more closely next.

We will focus more academic mechanisms (and what we can do about them) as they are more structural and inter-personal in nature. Thus closer to our spheres of influence to address the inequities of citation practices.

**Instructor Notes**: Highlight to learners that they were introduced to some of these mechanisms in the section earlier about barriers to publishing.
:::

---

## Academic mechanisms: Plagiarism, citational cliques, "hidden curriculum"

::: callout-note
## Definitions

-   **Plagiarism:** To present work ideas from another author or work as one’s own *without crediting* the source [@park2003]

-   **Citational cliques:** A citational practice that describes how networks of authors or journal editors can game the system by *excessively citing* each other to increase their *citational metrics* (H-Index for authors, Impact Factors for journals) [@franck1999; @kojaku2021].

-   **Hidden Curriculum:** A highly contextual set of social norms, practices and values *not explicitly taught* as part of official teaching. The impact of the hidden curriculum *disproportionately* felt by marginalized groups [@jackson1990] (e.g. many scholarly awards allow self-nomination, which might not be immediately apparent).
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: You may of heard about *Plagiarism*, *citational cliques* and the *"hidden curriculum"*. These mechanisms span structural and inter-personal levels. Plagiarism is to present work ideas from another author or work as one’s own *without crediting* the source.

Citational cliques: is a citational practice that describes how networks of authors or journal editors can game the system by *excessively citing* each other to increase their *citational metrics* (H-Index for authors, Impact Factors for journals).

Hidden Curriculum relates to the highly contextual set of social norms, practices and values *not explicitly taught* as part of official teaching. The impact of the hidden curriculum *disproportionately* felt by marginalized groups. For example many scholarly awards allow self-nomination, which might not be immediately apparent.

**Instructor Notes**: Signpost learners to the academic mechanism levels they learnt in the previous slides.

## Academic mechanisms: Linguistic privilege and inter/transdisciplinarity

-   *Linguistic privilege* and *inter/transdisciplinarity* are two contributors to citational disparities that are often overlooked.

::: callout-note
## Definitions

-   **Linguistic privilege:** The operating language of academia is English. Native (or near native fluent) speakers hold more advantages than non-native speakers in publishing, peer review process, citation rates and conferences [@müller2021]

-   **Inter/transdisciplinarity:** Scholars whose research covers multiple domains, especially in biological and health sciences, can be disadvantaged during the publishing process and are often evaluated the same as scholars working within a single domain [@levitt2008]

Linguistic privilege can also be a socio-economic mechanism, especially for people who have emigrated to a country with a different native language than their own and can experience barriers accessing services.

Inter/transdisciplinarity: Scholars whose research covers multiple domains, especially in biological and health sciences, can be disadvantaged during the publishing process and are often evaluated the same as scholars working within a single domain

Next we will look at how both socio-economic and academic mechanisms lead to positive or negative citation rates and their consequences for individuals and the research ecosystem as a whole

## Mechanisms and effects of citational inequities

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/6_mechanisms_effects.png" style="width:60%;"/>
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

There are several mechanisms that contribute to the inequitable citational patterns.

These mechanisms can positively contribute to citation rates such as elite networks or negative effects like misogyny as displayed in the table.

Over time, citational and institutional inequities can add up to more or less (academic) privilege

## The Matthew effect

The impact of biases and systemic inequalities in citation practices are *cumulative*:

-   Scholars with more *advantages* (e.g. white male privilege, citational cliques) are *more likely* to publish, be cited, receive academic recognition and promotion and vice versa for scholars experiencing barriers (e.g. sexism, racism, plagiarism).

::: callout-note
## Definition

The Matthew Effect is a phenomenon coined by @merton1968 after the 'rich get richer; poor get poorer' saying in the Gospel of Matthew. It describes the *self-reinforcing accumulation* of recognition and prestige within the academic system.
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

The impact of inequalities in citation practices are cumulative such that scholars with more academic and social advantages (i.e. privilege) are more likely to publish, therefore get cited more and go on to get more academic recognition

This also happens the other way with a cumulative *disadvantage* for scholars with fewer social and academic privileges. This phenomenon is called the "Matthew Effect".

The term was coined by Merton (1968) after the 'rich get richer; poor get poorer' saying in the Gospel of Matthew. It describes the *self-reinforcing accumulation* of recognition and prestige within the academic system.

## Group discussion exercise

**Pass the discussion (ball)**

1.  *Read* both case studies
2.  *Think* about mechanisms and effects
3.  *Discuss* the case studies as a group

::: callout-tip
## Questions to think about

-   What are some mechanisms you can identify?
-   Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms?
-   What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?
-   Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

In this activity of “pass the discussion (ball)” there will be two case studies to discuss. To contribute to the discussion, you must be holding the ball. The aim to identify key mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities

First you will *Read* both case studies. Then *Think* about mechanisms and effects and then we will come together as a group and *Discuss* the case studies. The pictures are also important context to the case studies.

There are four guiding questions to think about while you read the case studies - What are some mechanisms you can identify? - Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms? - What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies? - Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?

**Instructor Notes**:

Gamifying discussions encourages all learners to contribute. Divergent questions have wider set of possible answers which facilitate deeper engagement with topic (University of Waterloo, n.d.).

Activity delivery mode:

if an in-person class: ask learners to stand up (if able to) in a circle. (see speaker notes). Instructor reads case studies then passes the ball to a student who makes a point then passes ball on to the next student and so on. Start by addressing each case study in turn then compare and contrast them.

Online class (Zoom):

Have gallery view on Zoom, so each student is visible (ensure each student has their name written out). Instructor reads case studies then passes the imaginary ball. Passing the ball involves gesturing to throwing the ball at someone and calling their name to catch. The discussion process follows in person mode. As discussion progresses, to more easily see who has not yet spoken, have learners put hands up if they have not had the ball yet.

Hybrid class:

Follow blend of in person and online discussion process. Ensure the case study texts are visible to both in person and online participants.

If student catches the ball but has no point to add they can pass the ball to another student and contribute later in the discussion. At the end, instructor can check all learners have had a chance to contribute

*Accessibility tip:*

If learners are not able to pass the ball, instructor or nominated person can mediate the ball passing.

## Case study 1: Adriana

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/7_case_study_1_Adriana.png" style="width:60%;"/>
:::

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*:

Adriana is originally from Brazil and was the first in her family to go
to university. She is doing a post doc in Germany in computational
social sciences researching patterns of human migration.

After experiencing bullying during her PhD, she worked in industry as a
consultant and made R software packages and infographics in her spare
time (which were used widely but rarely credited).

Adriana is now part of a supportive interdisciplinary lab group and has
recently co-authored a paper in a specialty journal. She is finding it
challenging navigating the peer review system after multiple paper
rejections.

Her manager is flexible with her taking time off for childcare and has
been helpful in guiding her through the visa renewal process.

<img src="images/8_case_study_2_Andrew.png" style="width:60%;"/>
:::

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*

Andrew is British and a post-doctoral researcher at a Canadian university researching vaccines. After finishing his bachelor’s degree, his aunt helped him secure an unpaid internship in a top biomedical institute, where he met his future PhD supervisor.

He had a positive experience during his PhD, traveled extensively for conferences and continues to publish research with his PhD supervisor who is a key collaborator of head of the lab Andrew is in. Andrew recently had a paper published in a prestigious journal with a MSc student he co-supervised.

The lab head recently won a big grant allowing Andrew to extend his post doc for another year. This would allow Andrew to be a visiting researcher at another Canadian university for a month.

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Now we have both case studies side by side and the guide questions to help us in this discussion

**Instructor Notes**:

Having the case studies next to each other allows for easier comparison and referencing during the discussions.

Some additional questions designed to extend critical thinking and for more advanced learners:

In what ways does being a parent add potential barriers to Adriana's publication record?

*Answers:*

Additional competing demands (assuming that Adriana is the main care giver), less time to publish her research compared to her peers without childcare responsibilities, additional time tax and money to go to conferences to share her research (time and cost of arranging childcare).

How could Andrew's opportunity to be a visiting researcher in another university positively impact his citation rates?

*Answers:*

Increased networking opportunities by talking to other scholars, sharing his work increases awareness of his publications, building collaborations for future projects.

Some mechanisms are not always explicit (e.g. Adriana is likely to be less aware of the hidden curriculum as she is a first generation student).
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**: Here we have some clues as to some of the mechanisms operating for both people. Note that some mechanisms are not as explicit (e.g. Adriana is likely to be less aware of the hidden curriculum as she is a first generation student)

**Instructor Notes**:

Possible answers: What are some mechanisms you can identify? and can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms?

Adriana's mechanisms are mostly academic: less aware of the hidden curriculum as she is a first generation student, bullying, plagiarism, interdisciplinarity.

Andrew has a mix of academic and social mechanisms: with male privilege, support network, linguistic privilege

What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?

Adriana took some time away from academia after her PhD to work in industry, which reduced her publication output. This combined with her interdisciplinary field, publication in smaller speciality journal and challenges with the peer review system are additional barriers for her to publish and increase her citation rate. A smaller publication record puts her at a disadvantage for academic career progression based on current evaluation methods.

Andrew has a social support network (his aunt), collaborative research environment enabling him to cultivate collaborations, increasing opportunities to publish and even co-supervise a student. Often supervisory roles result in senior authorship, which is regarded more highly. These are key contributors to academic progression based on current evaluation methods (H-Index, publishing in prestigious journals).

Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?

Undervaluing of Adriana's interdisciplinary knowledge, unique perspectives from having worked in industry, less research innovation within her research area.

## The four stages to research

1.  **Planning:** project conceptualization, funding acquizition <br> <br>
2.  **Project:** literature search, data collection <br> <br>
3.  **Paper:** writing up research findings, submitting to a journal <br> <br>
4.  **Publication:** peer review process, publishing research

::: callout-note
## Note

In arts and humanities, outputs may not always be in a written format (e.g. art pieces, audio or video) or researchers dealing with ancient texts contain fewer citations than in STEM subjects [@colavizza2023].
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Even across disciplines the way we carry out and disseminate research can be broadly divided into four stages: planning, project, paper and publication

The planning stage involves project conceptualization and funding acquizition. The project stage is when we carry out literature searches, collect and analyze qualitative or quantitative data. The third stage involves writing up research findings to share with the world, this often involves submitting a manuscript to a journal. The last stage is the publication stage which covers the peer review process and actual publishing research.

## Self-reflect

Q1: When do you typically think about citations in your work?

-   [ ] Planning stage
-   [ ] While doing the project
-   [ ] When I write up my findings
-   [ ] At the publication stage
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

This exercise is in two parts, aimed to get you thinking about your own research process and when you think about citations. First on our own we will reflect on when do we typically think about citations in our work?

**Instructor Notes**:

This activity works well with at least 12 learners to generate discussions. Hybrid format is more challenging to carry out and therefore would recommend either fully in person or online.

Instructors should be mindful that in some disciplines like the arts and humanities outputs may not always be in a written format (e.g. art pieces, audio or video) or if written output (e.g. a monograph), research deals with ancient texts and contain fewer citations than in STEM subjects. See Colavizza et al. (2023)

*Accessibility tip:*

If moving around the classroom is not accessible to learners then encourage non-disabled learners to move to disabled person for group discussions. Consider having colored cards with research stage number and descriptions written on to help direct learners to their chosen discussion group.
:::

Q2: At which stage of research do you consider the most important to think about citations?

1.  [ ] **Planning:** (project conceptualization, funding acquizition)

2.  [ ] **Project:** (literature search, data collection)

3.  [ ] **Paper:** (writing up research findings, submitting to a journal)

4.  [ ] **Publication:** (peer review process, publishing research)

::: notes
**Instructor Notes**: This question is designed for learners to think more broadly about how and when citations are relevant as they conduct their research. It is likely many learners will choose 3 – during the paper writing stage. There is no incorrect answer as practicing conscientious citation happens throughout the research process.
:::

---

## Towards more mindful citation

-   We typically think about citations when we come to write up our research findings (paper stage)

-   This often reflects how we have been taught (citations as academic bookkeeping)

-   Thinking and acting more broadly in our citation practices requires *small incremental* and *sustained* actions

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

We are often taught to think about citations only during the write up stage of our essays, reports or manuscripts (stage 3), but practicing conscientious citation happens throughout the research process.

This often reflects how we have been taught (citations as academic bookkeeping)

## What does it mean to do a self-audit?

-   Self-auditing is an important part of *evaluating* your skill sets and ways of working

-   You are likely to do a self-audit multiple times in your educational or academic career (e.g. during a *performance review*, *training needs analysis* or *appraisal*)

-   Self-audits are a key part of professional or business *development*

::: callout-tip
## Definition

Self-auditing is a process of *self- reflection* and *evaluation* of one’s knowledge, skills or practices and taking *accountability* by implementing plans to *improve* standards/performance [@middleton2025].
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Part of self-auditing involves taking *accountability* by implementing plans to *improve* standards/performance

**Instructor Notes**:

Learners may have heard of self-auditing in the business sense, which you can share to help make the concept less abstract.

Aim to embody a growth mindset in approaching reflection of oneself. Emphasize to learners that it can feel uncomfortable and this is part of the learning process!
:::

---

## Tools to do a citational self-audit

-   Manually examining our reference lists is challenging due to unknown demographic markers of the authors we cite and it is time consuming

-   There are a number of tools that help automate this process like Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) [@sumner2018; @sumner2024], genderize, GCBI-alyzer [@fulvio]

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

If we were to examine the reference list of our own work, it is likely we would struggle to assess how diverse it is unless we know the authors we cite (also it is time consuming).

There are a number of tools that help automate this process like GBAT

As we have shown, there is a citational bias against women and a tool that is helpful to assess the gender diversity of your bibliography during the paper writing stage
:::

---

## Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT)

-   GBAT is an *automated web-based* tool that evaluates the *gender balance* of a bibliography list developed by @sumner2018 in response to the chronic under citing of women in political science

-   It works by *identifying* names from an author list, *estimating* the gender *probability* for the whole author list to produce a final *percentage estimate*

::: callout-note
## Caveates

GBAT uses *probabilistic inference* meaning it relies on algorithms to identify and predict the gender of names. It can misidentify authors' gender (e.g. those with uncommon names, names common to both genders or identifying as non-binary, transgender or gender diverse).
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

As we have shown, there is a citational bias against women and GBAT is a tool that is helpful to assess the gender diversity of your bibliography during the paper writing stage

This automated web-based tool was developed by Jane Sumner in response to the chronic under citing of women in political science

It is important to note that GBAT uses *probabilistic inference* meaning it relies on algorithms to identify and predict the gender of names. It can misidentify authors' gender (e.g. those with uncommon names, names common to both genders or identifying as non-binary, transgender or gender diverse).
:::

---

## Citational self-audit with GBAT

**Now to practice using GBAT:**

1.  *Open* your .bib or .txt document which has a bibliography list
2.  *Estimate* the % of women and % men in your author list
3.  *Go* to the [GBAT page](https://jlsumner.shinyapps.io/syllabustool/) and *follow* the instructions
4.  *Record* your final % gender balance score
5.  *Compare* your estimate with the GBAT score
6.  *Reflect* on the process: were you surprised by the result?

::: callout-tip
## Trouble-shooting

-   If an error occurs when uploading file, copy and paste author list into text box without bullet points
-   The GBAT tool can show “disconnected from the server” when left idle. To reactivate refresh the page.
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Now it is your turn to conduct a self-audit using GBAT.

First you will open your document containing a bibliography list from your own work and then try and estimate the % of women and men before using the automated tool.

Then go to the GBAT page and follow the instructions. Once you generate your score compare this to your estimates and reflect on the process.

You might notice you can also estimate the racial breakdown of the author list, but these are even less accurate and so for now we will focus on gender diversity.

**Instructor Notes**:

Activity delivery mode:

Works in all three formats: in person, online (Zoom) and hybrid, as learners will be working independently on their computer.

If learners don’t have the correct format for the GBAT assessment (e.g. .ppt or .docx) you can instruct them to select and highlight the reference list, copy and paste it into a text editor (Mac = TextEdit, Windows = Notepad) and save the file with a recognizable name OR to copy text directly into the box.

If reference list contains bullet points, these will need to be removed before copying text into text box.

The GBAT tool can show “disconnected from the server” when left idle and it can be reactivated by refreshing the page

This exercise consolidates learning of the issues of citational inequities (section 2) and offers learners a chance to apply their knowledge to their own work by practicing a citational evaluation tool. In addition, practicing should lead to improved confidence in adopting self-auditing tools longer term.
:::

---

## Reporting citational diversity scores

-   You can use the scores generated from GBAT or other tools to *write* part of a *citation diversity statement*
-   These statements are used to *raise awareness* and *mitigate* citational inequities
-   Citation diversity statements appear at the *start of reference lists* of articles and are increasingly *encouraged* by journals

::: callout-note
## Citation diversity statements

Citation diversity statements have *four* parts: *1)* the issues and importance of citational diversity, *2)* citation diversity scores (e.g. GBAT), *3)* methods and caveats of scoring approach used, *4)* a commitment to improving citational practices [@zurn2020].
:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Hopefully conducting the GBAT assessment made you reflect on your own work. You may wonder what you can do next?

GBAT and other tools can be used to write sections of citation diversity statements which appear at the end of reference lists.

Citation diversity statements have *four* parts: *1)* the issues and importance of citational diversity, *2)* citation diversity scores (e.g. GBAT), *3)* methods and caveats of scoring approach used, *4)* a commitment to improving citational practices.

## Final summary

-   Citation politics recognizes citations as more than academic bookkeeping. They are *choices* we make in whose knowledge is valued or sidelined, reflecting the inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* present in academia

-   Citation politics matters because these inequalities are *unjust*, leading to *epistemic hierarchies* that impact *individual scholars livelihoods* and the wider *research ecosystem*

-   We all have a role to play in addressing these inequities by doing citational self-audits and adopting tools that promote *conscientious citations*.

:::

::: notes
**Speaker Notes**:

Before we take questions and have the end of submodule quiz let's take the opportunity to summarize the key points of this submodule

We explored the concept of citational politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and practices for more contentious citations.

Citations are more than academic bookkeeping and reflect choices we make in who we cite and who we don’t.

Many of the mechanisms leading to citational disparities are systemic which create epistemic hierarchies

As individual researchers/scholars/students we can reflect on our citational practices and make choices about who we value and recognize when we cite.

This quote from the African American writer and poet Maya Angelou captures the process and values of addressing the politics of citation.

## Advanced task: Citational justice action plan

```{=html}

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/14_QR_code_sauve_et_al.png" style="width: 50%;" />

```

<!-- Right side: bullet points -->

::: {style="flex: 1;"}
Using the Citational Justice Toolkit by @sauvé:

-   Pick *one tool* or *practice* to commit to implementing in your work over the next X number of months

-   To remain *accountable*, share the *time frame* and *evaluation* of implementing a citational tool/practice with *someone else* in class.

**Speaker Notes**:

For those of you keen to learn more tools and practices for more mindful citations this advanced task involves making a citational justice action plan with accountability buddies.

This QR code takes you to the article, then take a look at figure 2 on page 10.

Earlier in the session we introduced some of the tools and practices, now spend some time choosing one of those tools/practices you can implement in your own work

The next slide I will show some guiding questions to help create your plans and help review your accountability buddy's plans.

**Instructor Notes**:

Activity delivery mode:

In person:

On the screen show Figure 2 on page 10 of the article on the OSF page. Learners can also scan the QR code to the citational justice toolkit Figure 2 to follow along themselves. Allow learners time to choose one tool or practice.

Ask learners to write down which tool or practice they plan to commit to and ask them to 1) explain why they have chosen this tool/practice, 2) why is it needed in their work/research context, 3) explain how they will evaluate the success of their chosen citational tool/practice after X months. 4) Decide what action you will take in the coming 1) days, 2) weeks, 3) months/end of term.

After learners have a had a chance to self-reflect and devise a strategy for implementing the tool/practice, ask them to find an accountability buddy from someone else in the course. Ask them to share their strategies and schedule mutual check in for the 3 check-in points to assess each other’s progress.

Online (Zoom):

Similar format to in person, but learners will use break out rooms for pairs to discuss their citational justice action plan

Hybrid:

Similar format to in person, but learners joining online will discuss citational justice action plan in break out rooms and in person learners will buddy up with in person attendees.

This task promotes self-reflection, critical thinking and a sense of agency in the choices that are made in how and who we cite. Setting manageable goals and check-ins makes it less overwhelming and more attainable. Accountability buddy system allows learners to mutually support each other in reaching their goals and reduces anxiety.

Allow learners time to think about their own research cycle and where they can improve their citational practices. This task format follows a similar style to Liboiron (2023)

## Citation diversity statement

::: callout-note
Citation practices are not neutral and disparities exist in whose knowledge is recognized and whose not, with women, Black, Indigenous, disabled and other marginalized groups consistently underrepresented in reference lists. To that end, we actively sought out papers from a range of disciplines, and researchers, with a bias towards uplifting Global Majority scholars. We assessed the gender diversity of our reference list using the Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) by @sumner2018. Names were identified from the author list, and an estimate of the gender balance was produced using proboblastic techniques, where the author list in this training module contains approximately 49.32% women and 50.68% men. We acknowledge this method can misidentify an author's gender especially those with uncommon names, names common to both genders or identifying as non-binary, transgender or gender diverse. We strive to continually improve on the quality and diversity of our resources we draw upon in our training materials and are open to suggestions.
