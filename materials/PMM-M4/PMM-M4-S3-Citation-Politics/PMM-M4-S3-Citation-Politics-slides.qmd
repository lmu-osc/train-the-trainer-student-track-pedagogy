## Your citation politics journey
<br>
<br>
From: "I am not sure what citation politics is or why it is important" 
<br>
<br>
To: "I feel empowered to adopt more contentious citation practices"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Before we start: Results of survey!

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*

Let's take a look at the results of the short survey that was sent out
before class. We will then compare our answers at the end of class.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How *familiar* are you with the concept of citational politics?**

**Scale 1 to 5: 1 = never heard of it, 5 = extensive knowledge.**

1. [ ] Never heard of it 

2. [ ] Basic knowledge, but cannot describe in detail

3. [ ] Some knowledge and can discuss

4. [ ] Some knowledge, can discuss and relate to with other issues

5. [ ] Extensive knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How would you rate your *confidence* to carry out an audit of your
citational practices on your work?**

**Scale 1 to 5: 1 = Not confident at all , 5 = Completely confident)**

1. [ ] Not confident at all

2. [ ] Slightly confident

3. [ ] Somewhat confident

4. [ ] Very confident

5. [ ] Completely confident

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**List three adjectives that you expect or hope to *feel* at the end of
the class**

## Section 1: Introduction to citations

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

In this first section we will take a look at what citations are

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Warm up question to get us started!

**What are citations, and why do we cite?**

1.  *think* about answer on your own
2.  *discuss* answer with neighbor and *write* out a joint answer
3.  we will *share* our answers in class

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*:

We will now do a think-pair-share activity based on a two part question:
What are citations, and why do we cite?

On your own you will first think about the answer. Then find a partner
to discuss your answers before writing out a collective response to the
question. We are aiming for a sentence or two answer. Then we will come
together and each pair will report back their answers before we discuss
as a class.

*Instructor Notes:*

Activity delivery mode:

If an in-person class: Learners first think about answers individually.
Learners then discuss in pairs their answers and write a collective
response on a post it note. Invite learners to explain their answers,
one pair at a time. Stick their post it notes answers on the class
board.

Online class (Zoom): Have learners think independently before discussing
answers in pairs in break out rooms. Ask pairs to submit their answer in
a pre-prepared Mentimeter and project onto Zoom whiteboard

Hybrid class: Particify (requires in person learners to have access to
device to participate). Follow steps outlined in online class mode,
where in person learners and online learners pair up respectively.

*Accessibility tip:*Explain to learners why the tasks are designed the
way they are (link to learning objectives). Setting out expectations of
the class should increase engagement (e.g. improved note taking and in
class discussions)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are citations?

::: callout-note
## Definition

-   A reference to an information *source*, where the original author is
    given *credit*.

-   Citations map out the lineage of ideas upon which scholarship is
    built and informs what knowledge we *value* and whose knowledge we
    *platform*.

-   Citations are a key *currency* in academia where more citations
    equal more *prestige* (e.g. H-Index) (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).
:::

For example, this definition cites work by Sauve and colleagues from
2025 where the full reference will appear in the bibliography at the
end.

::: notes
*Speaker notes* In everyday life we use citations, perhaps without
realizing, for example verbal citations “X said this y”.

This is the basis for the basic definition of a citation: a reference to
an information source, where the original author is given credit.

But citations are more than referencing an information source

In the current academic system, patterns of citations reflect dominant
world views (Western, racialized white men, Anglophone, non-disabled,
higher socio-economic status)

How and who we cite informs what type of knowledge we value and whose
knowledge we platform

*Instructor Notes:* Link definition presented here to answers learners
gave in the warm up question
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Citations as a knowledge map

-   Citations play an important role in tracing the *conceptual* origins
    and evolution of *ideas* during literature searches (Ghosal *et
    al.,* 2022)

-   Citations are used to provide background *context* to piece of work,
    particularly in introductory sections.

-   Some papers cite other works with closely tied research themes,
    *build* on these ideas and *push* the boundaries of knowledge in new
    directions.

::: callout-tip
## Did you know?

The study of citations and other bibliographic data is known as
*bibliometrics* (Donthu *et al.,* 2021)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analyzing citation practices

*Bibliometric* analyses can reveal patterns in citation practices (e.g.
most cited papers or scholars and citational clusters)

:::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/citation map.png" style="width:40%;"/>

::: {style="font-size: 0.6em; margin-top: 0.5em;"}
<em>Figure adapted from Lin *et al.* (2022)</em>
:::
::::

::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 

Citation practices can be analyzed using bibliometric
analyses. It can show you who cites who and identify clusters of
citation bubbles.

This colorful network maps by Lin et al shows the citations of documents
relating to the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction.
Different color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes
represents the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes
indicates their correlation.

*Instructor Notes:*

Indicate that the next slide the components of this
network map will be explained.
:::

-   A *node* is like a busy urban center with *links* to other nodes via
    highways, where several nodes can form *clusters*

-   Analogy: the Changning, Hongkou, Yangpu districts (*nodes*) have
    closer *links* forming city of Shanghai (*cluster*) compared to
    districts in Jiaxing \>100 km away

-   Figure adapted from Lin *et al.* (2022)

*Speaker Notes:*

-   We can map knowledge relationships made up of nodes that link
    together using Bibliometric analyses
-   This colorful network maps out citations of documents relating to
    the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction. Different
    color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes represents
    the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes
    indicates their correlation.
-   We can also see how these knowledge maps change through time
-   This particular figure was made using VosViewer

*Instructor Notes:*

-   To add an interactive element to this slide you can ask learners to
    guess which paper is cited the most based on figure from Lin *et
    al.* (2022). Answer is the largest node labelled as "paulus
    (2023)" - the red one on the top left of the image.

## Citation metrics as an evaluation tool

Citation metrics (e.g. H-Index) are an evaluation tool used to make
important decisions like career progression, funding allocations and
conference speaker invites (Gupta *et al.,* 2023).

::: callout-note
# Definition

-   Hirsch's Index (H-Index) is an author-level metric used to assess
    *productivity* and *impact* of publications (Hirsch, 2005)

-   It is calculated by the number of publications with citation number
    ≥ h (e.g. if a scholar has a total of 10 publications and 7 of those
    each have at least 7 citations, then their H-Index = 7)
:::

Scholars with higher H-Indices are often evaluated more highly, but
there are inherit *biases* with this...

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

Citation metrics like the H-Index are an evaluation
tool used to make important decisions like career progression, funding
allocations and conference speaker invites

This metric was developed by a physicist Jorge Hirsch who was looking to
create objective measure of scientific achievement in his field of
theoretical physics.

It is an author-level metric calculated by the number of publications
with citation number greater or equal to h.

For example: if a scholar has a total of 10 publications and 7 of those
each have at least 7 citations, then their H-Index = 7

*Instructor Notes:* 

To provide more context about H-Indices you can
share some examples of famous scholars e.g. Albert Einstein who has an
H-Index of 129 (as of 10/09/2025 on Google Scholar)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Biases in citation metrics

The number of citations is not only a measure of *quality* and
*productivity*, as being highly cited relies on *opportunities* to
publish a lot which links to:

-   **Academic** factors: career stage, academic discipline,
    institutional affiliation, mentoring, support networks.
-   **Social, cultural** and **economic** factors: gender, race,
    ethnicity, nationality, socio-economic status, disability.

Where these factors *interact* and *compound* resulting in disparities
in citation rates.

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

The number of citations is not only a measure of
*quality* and *productivity*, as being highly cited relies on
*opportunities* to publish a lot.

It also does not necessarily correlate with validity of a publication
and can be skewed towards trending research topics

There are many factors that can influence how many publication you have
or even if you can publish your work.

These factors can be academic in nature such as whether you are early
career or niche academic discipline. Other factors relate to your
socio-economic and cultural identities.

Each of these factors *interact* and *compound* resulting in disparities
in citation rates.

*Instructor Notes:*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Citations as a politic

Citations are more than a technical formality.
<br>
<br>

::: callout-note
## Definition

-   Citations reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who
    they overlook in their work.
-   There are inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* that result
    in epistemic hierarchies – that is the recognition and
    legitimization of *dominant* world views at the *exclusion* of
    others knowledge systems (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).
:::

- There is lots of evidence to show citational biases towards Anglophone racialised white men across disciplines (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

-   As we saw with the example knowledge map, it is evident when we see
    a highly cited paper.

-   Citations reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who
    they overlook in their work.

-   It is just not about merit - there are inherent *biases* and
    *systemic inequalities* that result in epistemic hierarchies – that
    is the recognition and legitimization of *dominant* world views at
    the *exclusion* of others knowledge systems (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).

-   In the next section we will look at citation politics in more detail
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Section 2: Citation politics: the mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

In this section we will take a look at the mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patterns of citational inequities: Gender bias

- There is currently more research on gender bias in citation patterns than for other marginalized identities

- Madilda effect

::: callout-tip
## Did you know?

- The women's share of highly cited researchers (HCRs) *increased 0.9%* from 13.1% in 2014 to 14.0% in 2021. 

- To reach *parity* with men, women's share of HCRs would need to increase *100%* in health and social sciences and *500%* in engineering, chemistry and computer science (Meho, 2022).   
:::


**Next we will look at some mechanisms leading to disparity in citational patterns.**
    
::: notes
    
*Speaker Notes:* 

- As we saw earlier with biases in citation metrics, there are many factors that influence citation patterns

- There is currently more research on gender bias in citation patterns than for other marginalized identities

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Patterns of citational inequities: Racial bias


::: callout-tip
## Did you know?

Koffi,Pongou & Wantchekon (2024) analyzed 330,000 papers from 1950 to 2021 in economics
and found that Black, Hispanic and Asian scholars receive 5.1% to 9.6% fewer citations
than white scholars.

<img src="images/mechanisms and effects citation politics PMM-M4-S3.png" style="width:60%;"/>

::::

::: notes
    
*Speaker Notes* 

There are several mechanisms that contribute to the inequitable citational patterns.

These mechanisms can positively contribute to citation rates such as elite networks or negative effects like misogyny as displayed in the table. 

Over time, citational and institutional inequities can add up to more or less
(academic) privilege

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Academic mechanisms leading to citational inequities

*Plagiarism*, *citational cliques* and the *"hidden curriculum"* are some key contributors to citational disparities. 

::: callout-note
## Definitions

- **Plagiarism:** To present work ideas from another author or work as one’s own *without crediting* the source (Park, 2017)

- **Citational cliques:** A citational practice that describes how networks of authors or journal editors can game the system by *excessively citing* each other to increase their *citational metrics* (H-Index for authors, Impact Factors for journals). (Franck, 1999; Kojaku *et al.,* 2021)

- **Hidden Curriculum:** A highly contextual set of social norms, practices and values *not explicitly taught* as part of official teaching. The impact of the hidden curriculum *disproportionately* felt by marginalized groups (Jackson, 2002) (e.g. many scholarly awards allow self-nomination, which might not be immediately apparent).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Matthew effect

The impact of biases and systemic inequalities in citation practices are *cumulative*:

- Scholars with more *advantages* (e.g. white male privilege, citational cliques) are *more likely* to publish, be cited, receive academic recognition and promotion and vice versa for 
scholars experiencing academic barriers (e.g. sexism, racism, plagiarism).

::: callout-note
## Definition
The Matthew effect is a phenomenon coined by Merton (1968) after the 'rich get richer; poor get poorer' saying in the Gospel of Matthew. It describes the *self-reinforcing accumulation* of recognition and prestige within the academic system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Group discussion exercise

**Pass the discussion (ball)**

1.  *Read* both case studies
2.  *Think* about mechanisms and effects
3.  *Discuss* the case studies as a group


::: {.callout-tip}
## Questions to think about

- What are some mechanisms you can identify?
- Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms?
- What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?
- Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?
:::

::: notes
*Speaker notes* 
In this activity of “pass the discussion (ball)” there will be two case studies to discuss.
To contribute to the discussion, you must be holding the ball.
The aim to identify key mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities

First you will *Read* both case studies. Then *Think* about mechanisms and effects and then we will come together as a group and *Discuss* the case studies.

There are four guiding questions to think about while you read the case studies
- What are some mechanisms you can identify?
- Can you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms?
- What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?
- Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?

*Instructor notes* 
Gamifying discussions encourages all learners to contribute. Divergent questions have wider set of possible answers which facilitate deeper engagement with topic (University of Waterloo, 2025).
 
- Activity delivery mode:
if an in-person class: ask learners to stand up (if able to) in a circle. (see speaker notes). Instructor reads case studies then passes the ball to a student who makes a point then passes ball on to the next student and so on. Start by addressing each case study in turn then compare and contrast them.

- Online class (Zoom):
Have gallery view on Zoom, so each student is visible (ensure each student has their name written out). Instructor reads case studies then passes the imaginary ball. Passing the ball involves gesturing to throwing the ball at someone and calling their name to catch. The discussion process follows in person mode. As discussion progresses, to more easily see who has not yet spoken, have learners put hands up if they have not had the ball yet.

- Hybrid class:
Follow blend of in person and online discussion process. Ensure the case study texts are visible to both in person and online participants. 

If student catches the ball but has no point to add they can pass the ball to another student and contribute later in the discussion.
At the end, instructor can check all learners have had a chance to contribute

*Accessibility tip:*
If learners are not able to pass the ball, instructor or nominated person can mediate the ball passing.

## Case study 1: Adriana

:::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/case study 1 Adriana.png" style="width:60%;"/>

::::


::: notes
*Speaker notes* 
- Adriana is originally from Brazil and was the first in her family to go to university. She is doing a post doc in Germany in computational social sciences researching patterns of human migration. 

- After experiencing bullying during her PhD, she worked in industry as a consultant and made R software packages and infographics in her spare time (which were used widely but rarely credited).

- Adriana is now part of a supportive interdisciplinary lab group and has recently co-authored a paper in a speciality journal. She is finding it challenging navigating the peer review system after multiple paper rejections. 

- Her manager is flexible with her taking time off for childcare and has been helpful in guiding her through the visa renewal process.

## Case study 1: Andrew

:::: {style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="images/case study 2 Andrew.png" style="width:60%;"/>

::::

::: notes
*Speaker notes* 
- Andrew is British and a post-doctoral researcher at a Canadian university researching vaccines. After finishing his bachelor’s degree, his aunt helped him secure an unpaid internship in a top biomedical institute, where he met his future PhD supervisor. 

- He had a positive experience during his PhD, travelled extensively for conferences and continues to publish research with his PhD supervisor who is a key collaborator of head of the lab Andrew is in. Andrew recently had a paper published in a prestigious journal with a MSc student he co-supervised.

- The lab head recently won a big grant allowing Andrew to extend his post doc for another year. This would allow Andrew to be a visiting researcher at another Canadian university for a month.

- What are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?
- Can you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?
:::

::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 

Now we have both case studies side by side and the guide questions to help us in this discussion

*Instructor notes:*

- Having the case studies next to each other allows for easier comparison and referencing during the discussions.

- Some additional questions designed to extend critical thinking and for more advanced learners:

- 1. In what ways does being a parent add potential barriers to Adriana's publication record? 

*Answers:* Additional competing demands (assuming that Adriana is the main care giver), less time to publish her research compared to her peers without childcare responsibilities, additional time tax and money to go to conferences to share her research (time and cost of arranging childcare). 

- 2. How could Andrew's opportunity to be a visiting researcher in another university positively impact his citation rates?

*Answers:* increased networking opportunities by talking to other scholars, sharing his work increases awareness of his publications, building collaborations for future projects.

## Summary of sections 1 and 2

- Citations are more than *referencing* a source of information 
- Citations practices (e.g. citational cliques) can be *mapped* using *bibliometric analyses*
- Extensive documented evidence to show citational *biases* and 
*systemic inequalities*, particularly against women (e.g. Matilda effect)
- Citations are key *currency* in academia influencing hiring, funding and promotion decisions

::: callout-tip

## Take home message
Academic recognition is regulated via the *choices* we make in who we cite and who we do not.

:::

::: notes
*Speaker notes:*

In the first two sections we have learned that:
- Citations are more than *referencing* a source of information 
- Citations practices (e.g. citational cliques) can be *mapped* using *bibliometric analyses*
- There is extensive documented evidence to show citational *biases* and 
*systemic inequalities*, particularly against women (e.g. Matilda effect) 
- Citations are key *currency* in academia influencing hiring, funding and promotion decisions

In the first two sections we have focused on the problems, now we will switch our attention to equipping ourselves with doing something about citational disparities!

*Instructor notes:*
After summarizing the key take home messages of sections 1 and 2, use this opportunity to allow learners to ask questions

## Section 3: When should we think about citations?


::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 
Section 2 focused on mechanisms that are mostly structural and here we will focus on individual actions to address citational disparities

## Section 4: Conducting a citational self-audit


::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 


:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does it mean to do a self-audit?


::: callout-tip

## Definition
Self-auditing is a process of *self- reflection* and *evaluation* of one’s knowledge, skills or practices and taking *accountability* by implementing plans to *improve* standards/performance (Middleton *et al.,* 2025).
:::


::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 

Self-auditing is an important part of evaluating our skills sets and ways of working.
:::


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tools to do a citational self-audit?

If we were to examine the reference list of our own work, it is likely we would struggle to assess how diverse it is unless we know the authors we cite (also it is time consuming).

There are a number of tools that help automate this process like Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) (Sumner, 2018; 2020).

If we were to examine the reference list of our own work, it is likely we would struggle to assess how diverse it is unless we know the authors we cite (also it is time consuming).

There are a number of tools that help automate this process like GBAT

As we have shown, there is a citational bias against women and a tool that is helpful to assess the gender diversity of your bibliography during the paper writing stage

## Section 5: Wrap up and what can we do to move towards citational equity?


::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 
Now we will summarize the key points of the whole submodule, with a quiz and a revisit of the pre-submodule survey.

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Final summary: the what, why and how of citation politics 

- **What:** Citation politics acknowledges citations as more than academic bookkeeping. They reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who they overlook in their work. There are inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* that result in *epistemic hierarchies* 
<br>
<br>
- **Why:** Citation politics matters because these inequalities are *unjust* with big impacts on *individual scholars livelihoods* with wider implications for *research ecosystem* 
<br>
<br>
- **How:** As individual scholars we have a role to play in addressing citational inequities through applying tools and practices that promote *conscientious citations*.

::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 
- This submodule explored the concept of citational politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and practices for more contentious citations.

- The main takeaway is that citations are more than academic bookkeeping and reflect choices we make in who we cite and who we don’t. 

- Many of the mechanisms leading to citational disparities are systemic which create epistemic hierarchies

- As individual researchers/scholars/students we can reflect on our citational practices and make choices about who we value and recognize when we cite. 

:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## End of submodule quiz!


::: notes
*Speaker notes:* 
Now time for a quick quiz with four questions of a mix of multiple choice and true or false questions.


*Instructor notes:*
- Quiz questions focus on memory recall and incentivises learner engagement during class 

- Activity delivery mode:
In person/online (Zoom)/hybrid show questions on screen and have learners submit answers through virtual learning environment which logs their answers (personal computers needed in class for this)

*Accessibility tip:*
Allow open book for the quiz to assist learners with memory recall challenges
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q1. Citational politics is about:**

-   [ ] Enforcing a technical formality as citations are an important part of academic research practice
<br>
<br>
-   [ ] Recognizing that citation practices are not neutral in the current academic system and mechanisms leading to citational disparities are only systemic 
<br>
<br>
-   [ ] Reflecting on the choices scholars make in who they cite and who they overlook in their work because of inherent biases and systemic inequalities that result in epistemic hierarchies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q2. Which one of the following is an example of a mechanism typically resulting in academic advantages?**

-   [ ] Being an inter/transdisciplinary researcher
-   [ ] Being part of citational cliques
-   [ ] Having limited understanding of the “hidden curriculum”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q3. True or false, citation practices only matter when writing up my research?**

-   [ ] True
-   [ ] False

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q4. True of false, Part of (citational) self-auditing is about taking accountability for how we engage with the practice of citation?**

-   [ ] True
-   [ ] False

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Advanced task: Citational justice action plan with accountability buddies 

Using the citational justice toolkit by Sauve *et al.* (2025):

- Pick *one too*l or *practice* to commit to implementing in your work over the next X number of months

- To remain *accountable*, share the *time frame* and *evaluation* of implementing a citational tool/practice with *someone else* in the class.

::: notes
*Instructor notes:* 

**Activity delivery mode:**
*In person:*
display the citational justice toolkit Figure 2 on screen and allow learners time to choose one tool or practice.

Ask learners to write down which tool or practice they plan to commit to and ask them to 1) explain why they have chosen this tool/practice, 2) why is it needed in their work/research context, 3) explain how they will evaluate the success of their chosen citational tool/practice after X months. 4) Decide what action you will take in the coming 1) days, 2) weeks, 3) months/end of term.

After learners have a had a chance to self-reflect and devise a strategy for implementing the tool/practice, ask them to find an accountability buddy from someone else in the course. Ask them to share their strategies and schedule mutual check in for the 3 check-in points to assess each other’s progress. 

*Online (Zoom):* 
Similar format to in person, but learners will use break out rooms for pairs to discuss their citational justice action plan

*Hybrid:* 
Similar format to in person, but learners joining online will discuss citational justice action plan in break out rooms and in person learners will buddy up with in person attendees.


- This task promotes self-reflection, critical thinking and a sense of agency in the choices that are made in how and who we cite. Setting manageable goals and check-ins makes it less overwhelming and more attainable. Accountability buddy system allows learners to mutually support each other in reaching their goals and reduces anxiety.

- Allow learners time to think about their own research cycle and where they can improve their citational practices. This task format follows a similar style to Liboiron (2023)
