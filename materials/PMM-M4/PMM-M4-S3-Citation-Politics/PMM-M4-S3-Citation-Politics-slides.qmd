## Where are we at?

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

Here are the results from the survey

*Instructor Notes:*

-   Briefly examine the answers given to each question interactively
    with the group

-   Use visuals from the survey to highlight specific answers.

-   Make it clear to the group that there will be a similar
    post-submodule survey to examine understanding and learning
    progress.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Aim and overview of submodule

**Aim**: Examine the concept of citational politics, its links to
knowledge production and dissemination and learn to use some tools and
practices for more contentious citations. <br>

There are **five** sections to this submodule:

-   **Section 1**: Introduction and pre-submodule survey

-   **Section 2:** Citation politics: the mechanisms and consequence of
    citational inequities

-   **Section 3:** When should we think about citations?

-   **Section 4:** Conducting a citational self-audit

-   **Section 5:** Wrap up and what can we do to move towards citational
    equity?

::: notes
*Speaker Notes:*

The over all of this submodule is to examine the concept of citational
politics, its links to knowledge production and dissemination and learn
to use some tools and practices for more contentious citations.

There are five sections to this submodule where the first two sections
focus on the issues and the third and fourth sections focus on
solutions.

We will end with wrap up session and think about what next.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Warm up question to get us started!

**What are citations, and why do we cite?**

1.  *think* about answer on your own
2.  *discuss* answer with neighbor and *write* out a joint answer
3.  we will *share* our answers in class

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*:

We will now do a think-pair-share activity based on a two part question:
What are citations, and why do we cite?

On your own you will first think about the answer. Then find a partner
to discuss your answers before writing out a collective response to the
question. We are aiming for a sentence or two answer. Then we will come
together and each pair will report back their answers before we discuss
as a class.

*Instructor Notes:*

Activity delivery mode:

If an in-person class: Learners first think about answers individually.
Learners then discuss in pairs their answers and write a collective
response on a post it note. Invite learners to explain their answers,
one pair at a time. Stick their post it notes answers on the class
board.

Online class (Zoom): Have learners think independently before discussing
answers in pairs in break out rooms. Ask pairs to submit their answer in
a pre-prepared Mentimeter and project onto Zoom whiteboard

Hybrid class: Particify (requires in person learners to have access to
device to participate). Follow steps outlined in online class mode,
where in person learners and online learners pair up respectively.

*Accessibility tip:*Explain to learners why the tasks are designed the
way they are (link to learning objectives). Setting out expectations of
the class should increase engagement (e.g. improved note taking and in
class discussions)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What are citations?

::: callout-tip
## Definition

-   A reference to an information *source*, where the original author is
    given *credit*.

-   Citations map out the lineage of ideas upon which scholarship is
    built and informs what knowledge we *value* and whose knowledge we
    *platform*.

-   Citations are a key *currency* in academia where more citations
    equal more *prestige* (e.g. H index) (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).
:::

For example, this definition cites work by Sauve and colleagues from
2025 where the full reference will appear in the bibliography at the
end.

::: notes
*Speaker notes* In everyday life we use citations, perhaps without
realizing, for example verbal citations “X said this y”.

This is the basis for the basic definition of a citation: a reference to
an information source, where the original author is given credit.

But citations are more than referencing an information source

In the current academic system, patterns of citations reflect dominant
world views (Western, racialized white men, Anglophone, non-disabled,
higher socio-economic status)

How and who we cite informs what type of knowledge we value and whose
knowledge we platform

*Instructor Notes:* Link definition presented here to answers learners
gave in the warm up question
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Citations as a knowledge map

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 2em;">

  <!-- Left side: single image -->
  <div style="flex: 1; text-align: center;">

  </div>
  
```

<!-- Right side: bullet points -->

::: {style="flex: 1;"}
-   *Bibliometric* analyses reveal patterns in citation practices (e.g.
    most cited papers or scholars)
-   A *node* is like a busy urban center that is linked to other nodes
    via highways, where several nodes can form *clusters*
-   Example: the Changning, Hongkou, Yangpu districts (*nodes*) have
    closer *links* forming city of Shanghai (*cluster*) compared to
    districts in Jiaxing \>100 km away
-   Figure adapted Lin *et al.* (2022)
:::

</div>

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*:

-   We can map knowledge relationships made up of nodes that link
    together using Bibliometric analyses
-   This colorful network maps out citations of documents relating to
    the medical field of Coronary microvascular dysfunction. Different
    color indicates different clusters. The size of the nodes represents
    the counts of citations. The distance between the two nodes
    indicates their correlation.
-   We can also see how these knowledge maps change through time
-   This particular figure was made using VosViewer

*Instructor Notes:*

-   To add an interactive element to this slide you can ask learners to
    guess which paper is cited the most based on figure from Lin *et
    al.* (2022). Answer is the largest node labelled as "paulus
    (2023)" - the red one on the top left of the image.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Citations as a politic

Citations are more than a technical formality.

::: callout-tip
## Definition

-   Citations reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who
    they overlook in their work.
-   There are inherent *biases* and *systemic inequalities* that result
    in epistemic hierarchies – that is the recognition and
    legitimization of *dominant* world views at the *exclusion* of
    others knowledge systems (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).
:::

::: notes
*Speaker Notes*:

-   As we saw with the example knowledge map, it is evident when we see
    a highly cited paper.

-   Citations reflect *choices* scholars make in who they cite and who
    they overlook in their work.

-   It is just not about merit - there are inherent *biases* and
    *systemic inequalities* that result in epistemic hierarchies – that
    is the recognition and legitimization of *dominant* world views at
    the *exclusion* of others knowledge systems (Sauve *et al.,* 2025).

-   In the next section we will look at citation politics in more detail

## Practical exercise 2

-   **Aim**: Design more practical exercises for students to apply the
    new skills in practise.

-   Depending on the topic, the exercises should be in accordance with
    the learning objective(s).

-   Add a description of the task, as well as a checklist as an overview
    of that your students need to be doing.

-   [x] Step 1

-   [ ] Step 2

-   [ ] Step 3

::: notes
*Speaker notes* For students who advance faster: Prepare extra
exercises.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Relevance and implications

-   **Aim**: To work out the relevance of the topic to your students.
-   In an interactive setting, discuss how the new skills could be
    applied in practise with specific examples.
-   Examine downfalls and practical obstacles.
