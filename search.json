To contribute to the discussion, you must be holding the ball. The aim to identify key mechanisms and consequences of citational inequities\nFirst you will read both case studies. Then think about mechanisms and effects and then we will come together as a group and discuss the case studies. The pictures are also important context to the case studies.\nThere are four guiding questions to think about while you read the case studies:\n\nWhat are some mechanisms you can identify?\nCan you distinguish between social vs academic mechanisms?\nWhat are the main differences in consequences that exist between these two case studies?\nCan you describe what are some of the negative effects to the research ecosystem?\n\nInstructor Notes:\nGamifying discussions encourages all learners to contribute. Divergent questions have wider set of possible answers which facilitate deeper engagement with topic (University of Waterloo, n.d.).\nActivity delivery mode:\nIf an in-person class: ask learners to stand up (if able to) in a circle. (see speaker notes). Instructor reads case studies then passes the ball to a student who makes a point then passes ball on to the next student and so on. Start by addressing each case study in turn then compare and contrast them.\nOnline class (Zoom):\nHave gallery view on Zoom, so each student is visible (ensure each student has their name written out). Instructor reads case studies then passes the imaginary ball. Passing the ball involves gesturing to throwing the ball at someone and calling their name to catch. The discussion process follows in person mode. As discussion progresses, to more easily see who has not yet spoken, have learners put hands up if they have not had the ball yet.\nHybrid class:\nFollow blend of in person and online discussion process. Ensure the case study texts are visible to both in person and online participants.\nIf student catches the ball but has no point to add they can pass the ball to another student and contribute later in the discussion. At the end, instructor can check all learners have had a chance to contribute\nAccessibility tip:\nIf learners are not able to pass the ball, instructor or nominated person can mediate the ball passing."

They are choices we make in whose knowledge is valued or sidelined, reflecting the inherent biases and systemic inequalities present in academia\nCitation politics matters because these inequalities are unjust, leading to epistemic hierarchies that impact individual scholars livelihoods and the wider research ecosystem\nWe all have a role to play in addressing these inequities by doing citational self-audits and adopting tools that promote conscientious citations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake home message\n\n\n“Do the best you can until you know better.

Setting manageable goals and check-ins makes it less overwhelming and more attainable. Accountability buddy system allows learners to mutually support each other in reaching their goals and reduces anxiety.\nAllow learners time to think about their own research cycle and where they can improve their citational practices.

We assessed the gender diversity of our reference list using the Gender Balance Assessment Tool (GBAT) by (sumner2018?). Names were identified from the author list, and an estimate of the gender balance was produced using proboblastic techniques, where the author list in this training module contains approximately 49.32% women and 50.68% men. We acknowledge this method can misidentify an author’s gender especially those with uncommon names, names common to both genders or identifying as non-binary, transgender or gender diverse.

    "text": "How can I give feedback on the materials?\nDo you feel like there is content missing from the slides? Do you want to share your own ideas about pedagogical activities you tried when teaching about Open Research? Have you spotted another way to improve our materials, or would like to add or contribute to the materials? We would love to hear your feedback! There are different ways to give feedback:\n\nThe quick and easy way: Contact the program coordinator, Sarah von Grebmer (LMU Open Science Center).\nThe pro way (involves GitHub): Navigate to the GitHub repository and open an issue, see here for instructions on how to do this. Provide a descriptive title for your feedback, and describe your feedback in greater detail in the text box. Include which materials you want to provide feedback on, what the issue is and if it is low, medium or high priority. Tag Sarah von Grebmer (using her GitHub username SvonGrebmer)."

    "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat previous teaching experience do I need?\n\n\nNo prior teaching experience is required! The materials will introduce you to the teaching basics. It is helpful if you have given a talk or presentation to an audience before. Also, it is critical that you know the audience you are teaching or going to teach.\n\n\nDo I need to be familiar with Open Research to use these materials?\n\n\nYes! We do require a basic familiarity with Open Research principles. This is because the aim of the current materials is to develop your pedagogical skills to convey your Open Research knowledge and skills to different audiences. We will work with practical examples directly from Open Research. If you feel like you need to develop your Open Research skills first, please browse the available self-paced tutorials in our self-learning catalogue.\n\n\nI am not a member of the LMU Open Science Center, can I still use these materials to develop my skills?\n\n\nYes! These materials are made for educators beyond the LMU Munich. However, if you are based at LMU, consider joining the LMU Open Science Center to support the goal of open, responsible, and reproducible research within your disciplines or at LMU Munich more broadly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCannot find the answer you are looking for?\n\n\n\nPlease get in touch with the program coordinator, Sarah von Grebmer (LMU Open Science Center)."

The outcome statements contain a learning activity, a verb, [that] verb says what the relevant learning activities are that the students need to undertake in order to attain the intended learning outcome. Learning is constructed by what activities the students carry out; learning is about what they do, not about what we teachers do. Likewise, assessment is about how well they achieve the intended outcomes, not about how well they report back to us what we have told them or what they have read’ (Biggs n.d.)."
